# Class 1: Tokenization and Prompting
Today we'll explore some basics of language models, starting with how they represent text as tokens (**tokenization**) and moving on to how this representation can influence model behaviour when a user is **prompting** the model.

## NLP Paper Showcase 
If you're interested in this topic, I suggest reading:

> [Whatâ€™s the Difference? Supporting Users in Identifying the Effects of
Prompt and Model Changes Through Token Patterns](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.985.pdf)" by Hedderich et al. (2025)

This paper presents "Spotlight", an approach to identify token patterns in prompts to make `prompt-engineering` more transparent for users. Brand new paper from the biggest NLP conference "ACL2025"!
