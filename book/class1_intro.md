# Class 1: Basic Text Processing
All over social media, people claim that they can spot *AI-generated* text by word choices such as "delve" or "embark". Today we'll be exploring a dataset by {cite:t}`herbold_large-scale_2023` containing both ChatGPT and student-written essays. While you are solving the exercises, keep this question in mind:


```{admonition} Main Question
Does the word distribution of ChatGPT-written essays differ from student essays? And if so, how?
```
As you will see in the exercises, we can already begin to explore such a question with fairly simple text processing approaches !


## Let's do some exercises
The next few pages contain code examples (to help you get started) along with some questions and hands-on exercises. Before you click on, remember to start your UCloud run and create a new Jupyter Notebook as described in the **[Class Setup](../book/getting_started/class_setup.md)**.
