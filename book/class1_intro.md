# Class 1: Basic Text Processing
All over social media, people claim that they can spot *AI-generated* text by word choices such as "delve" or "embark". Today, we will be looking into whether there are a differences in the word choices in essays written by students and by ChatGPT (dataset by {cite:t}`herbold_large-scale_2023`). 

As you will see in the exercises, we can already begin to explore such a question with fairly simple text processing approaches !


## Let's do Exercises
We are *almost* ready to begin the exercises! Before moving on, you need to start your UCloud run and create a new Jupyter Notebook as described in the **[Class Setup](../book/getting_started/class_setup.md)**.
