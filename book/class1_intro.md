# Class 1: Exploring Word Distributions
All over social media, people claim that they can spot *AI-generated* text by word choices such as "delve" or "embark". We'll explore this phenomena with data from {cite:t}`herbold_large-scale_2023` containing both ChatGPT and student-written essays. For today's exercises, keep this question in mind:

```{admonition} RESEARCH QUESTION
Do the word distributions of ChatGPT-written essays differ from student essays? And if so, how?
```

### Learning Goal(s)
Todayâ€™s goal is to introduce you to Python text processing basics with an *added* bonus being to explore the research question above. Do not worry about finishing everything or if you focus more on the coding than on the question. The important part is to use your NLP brain! 

## Let's do some exercises
The next few pages contain code examples (to help you get started) along with some questions and hands-on exercises. Before you click on, remember to start your UCloud run and create a new Jupyter Notebook as described in the **[Class Setup](../book/getting_started/class_setup.md)**.
