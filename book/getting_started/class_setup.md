# Class Setup (workflow)
At the beginning of most NLP classes, you will need to go through the same workflow before proceeding to the coding exercises.

We recommend sticking to the workflow (including folder names) to make it easier to use provided code snippets. Troubleshooting will also be wayyyy easier if we all have the same setup!

```{tip} 
You can check whether UCloud is down at: [https://status.cloud.sdu.dk](https://status.cloud.sdu.dk/)
```

## Step 1. "Running a job" on UCloud
- Choose the right workspace (`NLP-something-something`). If you're not part of it, check instructions on the course page on `Brightspace`. 
- Find Coder Python
- Name your job 
- Mount a folder (recommended way)

## Step 2: Adding a New Notebook (Inside Coder Python)
I recommend creating a folder called `nbs` (short for "notebooks") by right clicking the sidebar.

Give the file a name with the extension `.ipynb` (e.g., `class1.ipynb`). 

Note: If you already have a notebook, you can *drag* it from your computer to the sidebar.

## Step 3: Setting up your Jupyter Notebook
- Code versus text chunks
- Import necessary packages in the very first chunk (code chunk) at the top ... 

## Notebook Template
