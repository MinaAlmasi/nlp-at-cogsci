# Technical Requirements
We will be coding in the app `Coder Python` on [UCloud](https://cloud.sdu.dk/) and using mostly `Jupyter Notebooks`.

```{important}
We **strongly** recommend the use of UCloud. 

If you do not wish to use it, you are welcome to run things on your own machine. However, due to time constraints, *we will not be providing any technical support if you choose to go this way*.
```

## Other tools 
During the course, we'll be learning how to create [virtual environments](../advanced_workflow/virtual_environments.md) and how to use `GitHub`. For the sake of simplicity, we'll wait a few classes before introducing these! If you know how to use them, go ahead!
